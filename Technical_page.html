                    This is a quick overview of the correct and safe methods of testing fixed wire
                    electrical installations. Following the correct proceedures will ensure that you
                    remain safe during the process and that risk of damage to the installation is 
                    minimised.

                <p>
                    Before you undertake the testing of an installation, it is important that you are
                    familiar with how a circuit is installed and the devices connected. In the UK, we have 
                    common features that appear in an installation. Some of these include the use of: ring 
                    final circuits, radial circuits, wiring in twin and earth cable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A standard domestic installation would have some, if not all of the following:</br>
                        <code>32A cooker or hob circuits wired in 6 mm to 10 mm</code></br>
                        <code>32A immersion circuit wired in 2.5 mm</code></br>
                        <code>32A ring final circuits wired in 2.5 mm or 4 mm</code></br>
                        <code>20A radial power circuits wired in 2.5 mm</code></br>
                        <code>6A radial lighting circuits wired in 1.5 mm or 1 mm</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's also important to understand how the switch gear works, how it is selected and 
                    how it is populated in the distribution board. There are electrical wiring regulation that 
                    determine selection and erection of devices. The regs should be consulted if and when 
                    there is uncertainty as to the correct selection of such equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are other factors involved with testing and that includes familiarity with how the 
                    wiring may have been installed. Knowing how to identfy if rinds or radials are used, which 
                    way from the dist board might have been chosed to wire and splits of sockets or points 
                    scattered within the building.

                <p>
                    The choice of the correct electrical testing equipment is vital in ensuring both safety 
                    and recieving the correct readings to determine the condition of the installation. A basic 
                    18th edition multi function tester will perform all the test required, some just do it
                    easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Testers as a basic requirement must comply with GS38 regulation, some of which the points
                    to conform to are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Probe tips must be no longer than 4 mm or be retractable</li>
                        <li>Probes must be fused inline</li>
                        <li>Probes and leads must be identifiable by different colours</li>
                        <li>Must have finger barriers</li>
                    </ul>

                    Dead testing is as it says, performed with the whole installation de-energised. A proving unit 
                    should be used to confirm. There are a number of tests to be performed and they are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continuity of earth connectors</li>
                        <li>R1 and R2</li>
                        <li>Insulation resistance</li>
                        <li>Separation of circuits</li>
                        <li>Polarity</li>
                    </ul>
